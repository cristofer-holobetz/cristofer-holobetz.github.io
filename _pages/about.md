I am a PhD student at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/). I work with [Andrew Saxe](https://www.saxelab.org) here at the SWC and [Thomas Akam](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/cognitive-circuits) at Oxford. My projects involve both testing theories of learning and generating new ones.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
